# AstroneerAstropedia

## About this repository

**AstroneerAstropedia** is the out-of-box *Astropedia* of the [Astroneer](https://astroneer.space/) game and is focused on keeping things clear and easy to use and learn. All content here is findable inside the game, in [Xbox Live Account](https://account.xbox.com/en-us/Profile), and/or the official [Atroneer Wiki](https://astroneer.fandom.com/wiki).

The main objective to use this APP is to help in-game avoid the action of opening the *Astropedia* in-game all time and/or research for content on the internet. With this APP you will have the *Astropedia* content in your hand as an "extra" screen to see only content not related to the gameplay itself.
